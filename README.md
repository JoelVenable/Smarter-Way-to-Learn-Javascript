# Smarter-Way-to-Learn-Javascript

This github project contains my notes following along with the book "A Smarter Way to Learn Javascript" by Mark Myers.  While the included files are a mixture of .js and .html files, the files are intended to be read from within a code editor.  

.js files are all executable, though I modified the instructions to run in a node.js environment (shell terminal).  The biggest implication of this difference is the use of console.log() instead of alert() throughout the text.
