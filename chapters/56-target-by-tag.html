So what if you want to target multiple elements with the same function?  We could give each paragraph an ID to enable a function...

<script>
  document.getElementById(theID).style.fontSize = "2em";
</script>

Instead we could use the getElementByTagName() method.

<script>
  var parag = document.getElementsByTagName("p");
</script>

The variable 'parag' now holds an array of all the paragraphs in the document.  So let's assume our markup has the following 'p' tags:

<p>This bed is too small.</p>
<p>This bed is too big.</p>
<p>This bed is just right.</p>

We could then write:

<script>
  var someText = parag[1];
</script>

and our variable would contain "This bed is too big."  We could then write:

<script>
  parag[1].innerHTML = "This SUV is too big.";
</script>

and the paragraph text changes to the assigned string.  We could also loop...

Note I'm bringing back some more advanced stuff that I've learned.  
<script>
  parag.foreach(el => {
    el.style.fontFamily = "Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif";
  });
</script>

This stantement maeks a collection of all the images and assigns to the variable 'pics':

<script>
  var pics = document.getElementsByTagName("img");
</script>

Or we could get all the 'div's:

<script>
  var divs = document.getElementsByTagName("div");
</script>

Or unordered lists.

<script>
  var ulists = document.getElementsByTagName("ul");
</script>
