Every node of a document is a parent and/or a child of another node.  The 'document' node has no parent and itself is the parent of the 'HTML' node, 
and text content of a 'p' tag often have no children.

xth child - In our simplified HTML document from the last lesson, 'head' is the first child of HTML, and 'body' is the 2nd child.  Therefore 
'head' and 'body' would be considered siblings.

<p>This is <em>important</em>!</p>

With this example, the 'This is ', the 'em' tag, and '!' are considered siblings.  The 'important' text is the child of 'em'.
