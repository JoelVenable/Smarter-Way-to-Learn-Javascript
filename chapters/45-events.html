<!--  JS powers the web...

//  Event handling: we'll start with inline even though that is not advisable for production use.  The reason we are doing it this way is because it is easier to learn.



When the following link is clicked, instead of going to another link, it reloads the page ("#"), then the 'onClick' property executes the Javascript alert message.

Also note the use of single quotes '' inside the onClick property, since it is enclosed in double quotes.

The page reload is also undesireable behavior, since it will also return the user to the top of the page when they may not have expected it.

<a href="#" onClick="alert('Hi');">Click</a>   

<!-- Better method-->

<a href="Javascript:void(0)" onCLick="alert('Hi!');">Click Here instead</a>

<!-- 
  
  This time nothing happens except for the alert message.  Better.

  Also, while inline JS is frowned on, we could use a function instead for a slightly more elegant solution.

-->
<a href="Javascript:void(0)" onCLick="popup('Hi!');">Click Here instead</a>
<script>
function popup(message) {
  alert(message);  
}
</script>
