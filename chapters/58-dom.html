DOM - Document Object Model

The DOM is an organization chart created by the browser when your webpage loads. Under the DOM, Javascript can
manipulate ANYTHING on the webpage. The HTML content as well as the CSS styling.

Javascript can also add, move, and delete things by manipulating the DOM. It's possible to create an entire webpage
using only Javascript DOM methods. So a simplified webpage follows:

<html>

<head>
  <title>Simple Document</title>
</head>

<body>
  <div>
    <p>
      Some text.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another bit of text.
    </p>
  </div>

</body>

</html>
