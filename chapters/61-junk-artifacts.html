Some browsers interpret the whitespace used for 
readability of the HTML document as separate elements.  
They'll show up as '#text' nodes in the DOM tree.

MDN suggests one weird workaround:

<html
  ><head
    ><title
      >Simple Document
    </title
  ></head
>

This markup takes advantage of the fact that carriage returns and spaces 
inside the markup symbols are ignored by the browser.

So it fixes the DOM tree at the expense of readability.
An HTML minifier will also do the trick:

<html><head><title>Simple document</title></head><body><div><p>There's not much to this.</p><p>Nor to this.
</p></div></body></html>

Another approach is to use JS to sniff out the junk nodes.
<script>
var nType = targetNode.nodeType;
</script>

If the node is an element like a 'div' or 'p', the value in nType
will be the number 1.  A text node is number 3.

Suppose you want to replace text...

<div id="humpty">
  <p>All the king's horses.</p>
  <p>All the dude's crew.</p>
  <p>All the town's orthopedists.</p>
</div>

Code...
<script>
var d = document.getElementById("humpty");
var pCounter = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < d.childNodes.length; i++) { 
  if (d.childNodes[i].nodeType === 1) {
    pCounter++;
  }
  if (pCounter === 2) {
    d.childNodes[i].innerHTML = "All his men.";
    break;
  }
}
</script>

If you know you'll possibly be replacing the contents of a
markup element, it's much easier, and more common, to assign
an id to the specific element.
