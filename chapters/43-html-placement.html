  There's no hard rule about where to place JS in an HTML file.  Best practice is to create a separate JS file that is referenced with a <script> tag at the end of the HTML document, just before the closing <body> tag.

  For short JS code, it's possible to simply put the code directly in the <script> tags.

  For example:
-->

<script>
function sayHi() { alert("Hello world!"); }
function sayBye() { alert("Buh-bye!"); }
</script>

<!--  You'd include a JS file in an HTML file the same way as a CSS file...-->


<script src="01-alerts.js"></script>
